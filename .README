This is an implementation of a Code-First approach for Umbraco 4.7.x with a built-in preview engine.

It's currently built against 4.7.2, but it shouldn't matter at the moment.

To see how it's installed, look in the UmbraCodeFirst.Sample project.

A backup file of a clean install is included in the [Data] directory.

The login/password for the back-office is admin/password.

To enable synchronization of your code-first classes, change the enabled-attribute to true in the umbraCodeFirst.config file in the /config directory.

Get hacking, and let me know if you have any ideas.
